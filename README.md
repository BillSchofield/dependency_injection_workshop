# Dependency Injection Workshop

## Inline
* Instantiating a new Cat is easy.
* One class per animal.
* All behavior for each animal is in one place.
* Each new animal requires it's own behavior.
* Lots of duplication if there are multiple animals.

## Inheritance
* Instantiating a new Cat is easy.
* One class per animal. Lots of abstract classes.
* Reduces duplication.
* What happens if we have a new dimension of behavior.
* What does the class hierarchy look like as we introduce many animals.

## Strategy
* Instantiating a new Cat is easy.
* Strategies are easy to reuse
## Injected
